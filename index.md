We wanted to find out which words are accounted the most for reviews with two extreme star values, 1 and 5.
For the text analysis, we used sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer to fit and transform text data into a matrix of token counts. By fitting the model using Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, we were able to get two interesting results for each case.

Top 10 one-star tokens: 1) ontrac, 2) frechheit, 3) rudent, 4) discriminates, 5) unprofessionally, 6) telemarketing, 7) unprofessional, 8) insinuating, 9) discusting, 10) transcripts

Top 10 five-star tokens: 1) delivioso, 2) smoothest, 3) foodgasm, 4) deelish, 5) eloff, 6) yummmmmm, 7) wac, 8) addicting, 9) uuu, 10) gluch

In order to get a feel for where most of the data points (businesses) are located within the state of Nevada, we decided to plot the points on a map. There are two scatterplots and two heatmaps with varying zoom levels. As expected, we see that most of the datapoints within Nevada are in Las Vegas -- more specifically, the heatmap is more emphasized towards the The Strip (South Las Vegas Boulevard)
