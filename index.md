In order to get a feel for where most of the data points (businesses) are located within the state of Nevada, we decided to plot the points on a map.

As expected, we see that most of the datapoints within Nevada are in Las Vegas -- more specifically, the heatmap is more emphasized towards the The Strip (South Las Vegas Boulevard)
